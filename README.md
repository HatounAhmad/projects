# Train Management System

The Train Management System is a project that I developed using Java. The system allows administrators to add trains to the system and enables users to search for trains and make reservations.
## Key Features:

- **User-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The system features an intuitive interface for easy interaction by both administrators and users.

- **Separate Login Interfaces:** Administrators and users have distinct login interfaces tailored to their respective roles.

- **Train Management by Administrators:** Administrators can add trains with unique IDs, specify departure and arrival stations, and set the maximum number of passengers for each train.

- **Train Search and Reservation by Users:** Users can search for trains based on departure and arrival stations, as well as the number of passengers. They can also make reservations for available trains.

- **Real-time Validation and Error Handling:** The system includes real-time validation and error handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity and smooth user experience.

- **Data Storage:** Train information is stored using a file-based approach, with data serialized to maintain its structure and integrity.
